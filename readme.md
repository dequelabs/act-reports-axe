# ACT Reports for Axe

This repository contains ACT implementation reports for axe-core and axe DevTools Intelligent Guided Tests.

Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) rules are created by the W3C to precisely define how to test criteria of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). The reports in this repository are used to demonstrate that Deque's axe products are some of the most accurate tools in the accessibility industry, with the best coverage possible with automated tools.
